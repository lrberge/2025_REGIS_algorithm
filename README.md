### Algorithms for patent data

Welcome to the repository of the REGIS's course *Algorithms for empirical research* by Laurent Berg√© (2025-06-19).

The website of the course is: https://lrberge.github.io/2025_REGIS_algorithm/

You will find the slides [here](https://lrberge.github.io/2025_REGIS_algorithm/2025-06_REGIS_Berge.pdf) and the code [there](https://github.com/lrberge/2025_REGIS_algorithm/tree/main/code).

In the [resource](https://github.com/lrberge/2025_REGIS_algorithm/tree/main/resources) folder you can find the two papers corresponding to the two examples.

The [rmake-example](https://github.com/lrberge/2025_REGIS_algorithm/tree/main/rmake-example) folder contains the small rmake example.
